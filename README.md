# Pokemon XP Router

This is a tool that is intended to allow easy routing of Solo Challenges in playthroughs of generations 1-4 (generation 5 is planned). It is not designed for use in other formats.
It keeps track of the experience, stat experience/effort values, and your moveset over the course of the run and allows you to calculate precise damage ranges for every battle.
It also tracks your inventory, and your money.
While it will allow you to route any item usage, and any purchases, if it detects an invalid game state, it will flag events (e.g. using items you don't have, using money you don't have).
It is not intended to route the game for you, merely allow you to quickly test out ideas without requiring you replay large chunks of the game.

**NOTE:** This is a solo project done in my free time, so there are definitely some rough edges. I have manually verified the accuracy with several routes myself, but I cannot guarantee 100% accuracy. If you notice any discrepancies, let me know!
I recommend playing through the route once after mapping it out with this tool (or even playing it alongside the tool as you map it out) to guarantee its accuracy.

## Project status

I have taken over the project from Otto Tonsorialist and will continue it's development in my spare time. I intended to improve functionality, quality of life, and add support for newer games.
That said, I am working on this project primarily for my own purposes (video creation), and I will be strictly updating this software to be used with my own patches of the game, I will not be providing support for vanilla copies of the game.

## Final Notes

If you find any issues feel free to contact me, but I make no promises that this project will be maintainned in the future.
Use/reuse/steal any code, as you wish!
Or maybe don't, it's kinda hacky :)
